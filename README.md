## How It Works

The system uses a simple 1x1 transparent pixel to record views while maintaining complete anonymity:

1. When a page loads, it requests the tracking pixel from `/[image].js`
2. The API records a view for that specific image/page
3. A transparent pixel is returned with no tracking capabilities

```

## Data Structure

Views are stored with two levels:
1. **Total views**: Aggregate count for each image
2. **Daily views**: Breakdown by date (YYYY-MM-DD format)

Example response:
```json
{
  "example-image": {
    "totalViews": 1250,
    "dailyViews": {
      "2023-01-01": 50,
      "2023-01-02": 75
    }
  }
}
```
